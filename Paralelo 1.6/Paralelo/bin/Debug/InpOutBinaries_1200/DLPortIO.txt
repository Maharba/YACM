From Verison 1.0.0.8, InpOut provides basic DLPortIO compatibility, for use with LCDSmartie etc.

It has been tested with some applications but not extensivly. To use InpOut32 INSTEAD of DLPortIO, 
and allow older applications to run on x64 machines, simply RENAME (or copy) the 32bit DLL (in the \Win32 folder) 
"InpOut32.dll" to "DLPortIO.DLL", and replace the existing DLPortIO.DLL in your application's main folder (if it 
is not there, search your drive for DLPortIO.DLL and replace any instance you find!).

For example...
To use with an old version of LCD smartie that does NOT nativly support InpOut32: 

  o  Take the 32bit DLL (in \Win32) and rename it to DLPortIO.dll.
  o  Copy this DLL to your LCD Smartie folder.
  o  Run LCD Smartie and see if it talks to your parallel LCD Display.
  
Let me know if you have any problems.
